# Loading dataset

dataset = read.csv("/Users/ishakarim/Downloads/Copy of 2019 Winter Data Science Intern Challenge Data Set - Sheet1.csv")
head(dataset)

# A: 

    # The AOV given in the sample is $3145.13, which is the average of all total order amounts, i.e average of order_amount column
        avg_order <- sum(dataset$order_amount)/nrow(dataset)
        avg_order 

    # Issue: One customer may come back multiple times to make a purchase. By taking the average of order_amount, you account for aggregate, not individual, orders. Instead, each order would be factored into AOV separately.
    
    # Instead, divide total revenue (order_amount) by the number of orders (total_items). 
    
        aov <- sum(dataset$order_amount)/sum(dataset$total_items)
        aov 
        
        # AOV = $357.92

# B: I would look at the Revenue per Visitor metric to assess average revenue per visitor to the website, to tell us how much revenue each unique visitor is driving. 

# C: 

  # Step 1: Calculate Conversion Rate 
    unique(dataset$user_id) # Unique visitors 
    cr <- nrow(dataset)/length(unique(dataset$user_id)) # Divide 5000 because each order is unique (order_id), so there are a total 5000 checkouts 
    cr  
    
  #Step 2: Multiply AOV by CR 
      # RPV = (AOV x Conversions)/Total Unique Visitors
      # Given: (Conversions/Total Unique Visitors) = Conversion Rate
      # Therefore: RPV = AOV x Conversion Rate
    
    rpv <- aov*cr
    rpv
    
  # RPV = $5945.54
